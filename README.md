# MVP - Boilerplate (Python, React, MongoDB)

## 🚀 Overview
This is a **boilerplate project** built using the **PRM stack** (Python, React, MongoDB). It provides a solid foundation for developing full-stack applications with a well-structured backend, frontend, and database setup.

## 🛠️ Why PRM Stack?
- **Python (FastAPI/Flask/Django)** – Efficient, scalable, and easy to integrate with various services.
- **React** – Modern UI framework for building dynamic, interactive applications.
- **MongoDB** – A flexible NoSQL database that scales well with evolving data structures.

## 📌 Features
- **Pre-built Authentication System**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **API + Database Integration**: Seamless integration between the backend API and MongoDB.
- **Optimized for Scalability**: Designed to handle growing data and user base efficiently.
- **Easy Deployment with Docker**: Containerized setup for consistent and easy deployment.
- **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**: Modern and responsive UI components.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Fine-grained access control based on user roles.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Push notifications for real-time updates.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
